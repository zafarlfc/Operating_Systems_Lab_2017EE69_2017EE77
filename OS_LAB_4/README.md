<br> Use gcc 4-24.c -pthread to compile the C file and similarly other C files. The compiled files with .out extension are also provided.<br>
# Exercise 4.24
In this exrcise we the computed the estimated value of pi using the monte carlo approach. We implemented it using threads.

# Exercise 4.27
In this exercise we generated a fabonacci sequence using threads.
<br><br>
# Exercise 7.15
In this exercise we generated a fabonacci sequence using threads but in this case we eliminated the pthread_join function. the pthread_join function waits for the thread to terminate by suspending the calling thread which in this case is the main() function. So eliminating pthread_join allows parent thread to continue execution regardless of the child.

# Exercise 7.17
In this exrcise we the computed the estimated value of pi using the monte carlo approach, But in this case we created an array of thread for multi-threading and used mutex locks to avoid race condition.
