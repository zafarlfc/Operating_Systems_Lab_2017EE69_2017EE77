When the code is compiled and run, first we have to select how many processes. Then we select their burst times. After this, we select which operation to perform. 1 selects shortest job first, 2 selects first come first serve, 3 selects priority scheduling and 4 selects round robin. In case of priority scheduling, we also have to give process priorities. In case of round robin, a quantum number is used. In the end, the process no, burst time, waiting time, turnaround time, average turnaround time and average waiting time is printed.
